# Software Challenge with 42Heilbronn

## Getting started
In this challenge you can prove your expertise as a software engineer!

## Description
Anna, one of our colleagues at the customer solutions department has noted that her newest bakery customer still lacks trust into our AI generated order recommendations and therefore regularly adjusts and manually overwrites these orders. Anna is convinced that these manual adjustments often result in even higher leftovers at the end of the day and asks you to help her visualize the impact of these overwrites.
Her idea is to create a reporting view with which she can

1.	analyze how often past recommendation and delivery quantities differ (which means the customer has adjusted the order in the end) and  

2.	see whether these adjustments improved (the actual delivery quantity is closer to the demand than our order recommendation) or deteriorated the final orders (our order recommendation would have been closer to actual demand).

Since the BÃ¤ckerAI solution is used for planning orders in multiple stores and for multiple products, she asks you to build this reporting view that can filter for specific store and product combinations and visualizes the information in at least one graph. 

## Requirements

### Technical:
- Programming language: JavaScript or TypeScript
- Framework: VueJS (or any other comparable framework that you have experience with) 

### Functional:
- Visualize the differences between AI-based ordering recommendation and actual delivery quantity.
- Mark where original order recommendations were improved or deteriorated. Filter visualized products and stores. Include at least one graph.

### Non-functional:
- Create an appealing interface. Use the tools of your choice.
- Use tools that are common for software development, especially for larger projects.
- Think of how you can guarantee the correctness of the displayed information.
